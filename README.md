# Hangman Game

The "Hangman" game is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging figure is drawn. The player loses if the figure is fully drawn before they guess the word, and they win if they correctly guess all the letters in the word.

## Project Overview

This project is a implementation of the Hangman game, where the game logic and functionality are handled using JavaScript. The game allows the player to guess letters, tracks incorrect guesses, and visualizes the progress with a hanging figure.

## Functionality

The functionality of the game, including:

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Tracking of correct and incorrect guesses.
- Visual representation of the hanging figure with each wrong guess.
  
is implemented using **JavaScript**. The game interface, including the layout and design, is built using **HTML** for the structure and **CSS** for styling.

## Technologies Used
